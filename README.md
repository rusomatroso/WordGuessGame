# Beatles Game

_My hardest course project/ Homework so far!_

It's a game of guessing a word (hangman game). In this case one of the Beatles' songs title.

The project is a homework assignment given after a breif introduction to Javasript.
The main goal is to practice and apply the material leared in course and individualy.
Create a working game/project available for review and edditing through github.

Any question can be answered via email - evgeny23kl@gmail.com.

Thanks
